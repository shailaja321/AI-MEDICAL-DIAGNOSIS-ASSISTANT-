# Application Overview

## Project Title: AI Medical Diagnosis Assistant

### Problem Statement: 
Many individuals in rural or underserved areas lack access to quick and basic medical advice. Our AI Medical Diagnosis Assistant offers a simple interface where users can describe their symptoms and receive instant, preliminary medical guidance in their local language.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
A lightweight, multilingual Streamlit-based chatbot that accepts user symptoms via text input and provides possible diagnoses or suggestions, using an offline-first, open-source AI backend.

### Offline-First Strategy:
The app uses local caching, minimized external calls, and lightweight ML models to function in low-bandwidth environments.

# AI Integration Details

- Utilized an open-source NLP model for symptom-to-diagnosis matching.

- Integrated a rule-based engine and Infermedica-like dataset for safe, general-purpose medical predictions.

- All AI components are lightweight and run client-side or through efficient backend APIs to ensure offline compatibility.
