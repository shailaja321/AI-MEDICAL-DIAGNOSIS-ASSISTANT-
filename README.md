Diagnosis Rules:
✅ If a condition gets 3 “yes” responses from the user → immediately confirm diagnosis and stop.
❗ If a condition gets 2 “yes” responses and no other conditions have that many → suspect that condition and show it.
⚠️ If no condition has 2 or more “yes” → show a fallback message like “No clear diagnosis found, consult a doctor.”

📦 Deployment
Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Docker and .huggingface.yml.
